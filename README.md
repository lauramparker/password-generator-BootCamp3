<h3> Title: Random Password Generator</h3>
<h5><i>With User Input</i></h5>

<h3>Description:</h3> 
    This project contains javascript functionality to generate a random password based on use input. The intent of the project is to provide working code that incorporates beginning javascript elements such as variables, arrays, for-loops, and functions.   The project utilizes these elements and connects to a Bootstraped-enabled html file with basic styling.  The code includes an event listener connected to a single button (so that code begins when the user clicks to button) 
    
    The code asks the user to input the following information before rendering a password:

        1) Sets password Length (between and including 8-128 characters)
        2) Confirms if user wants to include uppercase letters in the final password
        3) Confirms if user wants to include lowercase letters in the final password
        4) Confirms if user wants to include numeric characters in the final password
        5) Confirms if user wants to include special characters in the final password
